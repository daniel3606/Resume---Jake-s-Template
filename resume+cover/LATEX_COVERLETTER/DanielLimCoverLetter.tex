\noindent Dear Hiring Committee,

\vspace{0.4cm}

My name is Daniel Lim, and I am a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Information with a focus on UX Design. I am reaching out to express my interest in an internship position that allows me to grow as both a developer and a designer while contributing meaningfully to a collaborative team.

I have always been drawn to creating things that people can see, use, and interact with. Whether I am building software, designing interfaces, or experimenting with new ideas, I find excitement in the process of turning abstract concepts into tangible results. Through my studies and personal projects, I have developed a strong foundation in programming, user experience, and visual design. More importantly, I have learned how to think critically, adapt quickly, and learn continuously from both successes and mistakes.

At my core, I enjoy connecting design and technology. I see code as a tool to make creative ideas come to life, and design as a way to make technology more human. My goal is to keep exploring this intersection by working on projects that challenge me to think from different perspectives and collaborate across disciplines.

I am eager to bring curiosity, adaptability, and a genuine passion for building and learning to your organization. Thank you for taking the time to read my application. I would appreciate the opportunity to contribute to your team and continue growing both personally and professionally through this internship experience.
